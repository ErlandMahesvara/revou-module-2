## About the Website

This website is a platform where users can share anything food-related. From writing reviews on specific dishes and sharing personal recipes to recommending favorite dishes to others, itâ€™s a community for all things culinary.

Initially, the website was intended to be a platform for book lovers, offering similar features for sharing reviews, recommendations, and discussions.
